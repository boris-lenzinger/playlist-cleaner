This small project was created after downloading quite a lot of videos from youtube
and not really knowing anymore what are those files.

The idea is to build a file listing all the files, then reading the videos. While
reviewing the videos, one can choose to pass to the next or decide to mark it as
to be deleted (hit d in the console).

At the end, the program show a summary of what will be deleted and the total size
of the deletion.

In case you handle some long playlist, it might be interesting to stop and restart
the work from a given point. The option --from lineNumber make is possible.
